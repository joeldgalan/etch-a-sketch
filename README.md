# etch-a-sketch

This Etch-a-Sketch project will function as a painting application.
It will have a functioning color, shade, and rainbow mode, as well as an eraser and clear button.
I also plan to include a grid toggle button, and finally a way to download the painting.
This was all created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
